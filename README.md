# Example source code for "The Waite Group's Object-Oriented Programming In C++" by Robert Lafore

The original example codes from this book are using Visual C++ and Borland C++ to compile on Microsoft Windows system.
If one compile these codes by using Turbo C++ 1.01/3.0 on DOS system will get ERROR messages. 
Therefore, I wrote a program to covert all examples to Turbo C++ style format at once.

[ Note ]

1. Not all converted examples can be compiled successfully because some examples are related to compiler itself and Microsoft Windows system.
If so, one need to use original example source codes, and compile those codes by using Visual C++ or Borland C++ on Microsoft Windows system.

2. Coverted example source codes have NOT been fully tested by any C++ compiler, yet. Please use them wisely.
