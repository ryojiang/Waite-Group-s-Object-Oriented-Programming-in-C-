# The Waite Group's Object-oriented Programming In C++

The original example codes for this book are using Visual C++ and Borland C++ run to compile on Microsoft Windows system.
If compile these codes by using Turbo C++ 1.01 on DOS system will get Error messages. 
Therefore, I wrote a program to covert all examples to Turbo C++ 1.01 style format.

However, not all example can be compiled suceed because some examples are related to Microsoft Windows system.
If so, one need to use original example source codes, and compile those codes by using Visual C++, Borland C++, or other C++ compiler on Microsoft Windows system.
